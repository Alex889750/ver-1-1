The AI engineer successfully developed a real-time cryptocurrency screener for MEXC exchange, starting from a basic HTML concept and evolving it into a professional, scalable application. Initially, a frontend mock-up was created for 10 tickers, quickly demonstrating dynamic price updates. This was followed by a robust backend integration using MEXC's public API, moving from mock data to live updates.

A key focus shifted to scalability, addressing the user's request for 250+ tickers. This involved significant backend optimization with batch API requests and efficient data handling, coupled with frontend virtualization and filtering for performance. Advanced UI/UX features, such as configurable columns for short-term price changes (15s, 30s), Max/Min sorting, and TradingView-style candlestick charts with multiple timeframes, were iteratively added.

The development faced challenges with sorting functionality breaking due to dynamic keys and a data retrieval error, leading to a revert to a stable version. The current task involves re-implementing the configurable columns and a history loading button from this stable baseline, ensuring previous issues are not reintroduced. The AI engineer consistently verified functionality with testing tools and provided detailed summaries of progress.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a real-time HTML cryptocurrency screener for 10 specific tickers (LTCUSDT, SHIBUSDT, AVAXUSDT, LINKUSDT, BCHUSDT, ATOMUSDT, XMRUSDT, APTUSDT, FILUSDT, NEARUSDT) on the Mexc exchange. The core requirement was real-time price display, updating every second, in a simple table format.

**Key Evolutions and Features Added:**
*   **Real-time Data Integration:** Transition from mock data to live data using MEXC's public API, updating every 2 seconds.
*   **Expanded Data Points:** Display of 24-hour change (absolute and percentage), and 24-hour trading volume.
*   **Short-term Price Changes:** Introduction of columns for 15-second and 30-second price changes (absolute and percentage) with color indication.
*   **Candlestick Charts:** Integration of 30-second candlestick charts for each ticker, displaying OHLC data.
*   **Scalability to 250+ Tickers:** Requirement to analyze and display data for over 250 coins.
*   **Configurable Display:** Setting to control the number of tickers displayed on screen (1-30).
*   **Column Sorting:** Ability to sort by any column (Symbol, Price, 15s/30s changes, 24h data, Volume) with ascending/descending options and Max/Min buttons.
*   **Advanced Charts (TradingView Style):** Replacement of simple charts with professional TradingView-style SVG charts, supporting 8 configurable timeframes (15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d) with up to 3 charts per ticker, displayed in expandable sections.
*   **UI Refinements:** Compact table rows, removal of background color from 24h % change (border only), floating settings panel, quick stats.
*   **Configurable Filters:** Implementation of 3 independent filter columns with 16 intervals (2s to 1 day), 5 operators (>, >=, <, <=, =), and percentage value settings.
*   **Historical Data Preloading:** User inquired and requested a button to preload 50 historical candles for charts across supported timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d).
*   **Dynamic Table Columns:** The three main data columns (initially fixed as 15s, 30s, 24h) should be user-configurable from the list of 16 intervals.

The primary problem being solved is providing traders with a powerful, real-time tool to monitor cryptocurrency price movements and identify short-term and long-term trends across a large number of assets on the MEXC exchange, with extensive customization and filtering capabilities.

<pending_tasks>
- Re-implement 3 configurable columns (2s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 30m, 60m, 240m, 1 day).
- Re-implement History load button with animation and status.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The current state of the product is a functional cryptocurrency screener that reverted to a previous stable version due to a data retrieval error. Before the revert, the application had extensive features, including:
-   Real-time price updates for 209 active MEXC tickers (out of 250+ requested).
-   Backend optimization using batch API requests for efficiency.
-   Frontend displaying 1-30 tickers at a time with virtualization.
-   Sorting by all columns (Symbol, Price, 15s change, 30s change, 24h % change, Volume) with Max/Min buttons and directional indicators.
-   Quick filters for top gainers/losers and volume.
-   TradingView-style SVG candlestick charts for each ticker, with configurable timeframes (15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d) displayed in expandable sections (up to 3 charts simultaneously, correctly showing different timeframes).
-   Customizable filter columns (3 independent filters) with a wide range of intervals (2s to 1 day), operators, and percentage values.
-   A Load History button that would trigger the backend to fetch 50 historical candles for supported timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d) using MEXC Klines API, filling the charts on load.
-   The three main table columns (e.g., 15s, 30s, 24h) were made configurable to any of the 16 intervals.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just performed a full revert of the codebase to a stable, working version due to a data retrieval error reported by the user, and the user has explicitly requested to re-implement two specific features: the configurable intervals for the 3 columns and the history load button from this stable base. The AI engineer has acknowledged this.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will begin re-implementing the configurable intervals for the 3 columns feature, as explicitly requested by the user in Chat Message 149.
